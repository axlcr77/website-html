        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a junior computer science student with an emphasis in Software Engineering
          I am originally from Orange, California now living in Provo, Utah.
          I recently got married and I am hoping to graduate in April of 2025

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          I am making an application that will help students review the things that they have already learned.
          Every few days the app will remind the student to review a topic that they have logged in to make sure they remember it.
          A student can also have the opportunity to randomly quiz themselves on any topic they have provided.
          This will ensure maximum retention for the student.
          I am passionate about this app because I have always struggled when taking tests.
          I was always feeling like I knew the contents of the class but when I took the test that feeling never showed.
          While doing research about good study habits I came across an article that talked about how reviewing a topic several days after helped with retention of the content.
          I began using an app called Notion that allowed me to log in the topics I had learned and make them readily available for me to review.
          However, I found myself not remembering to review the topics and simply going back to them when I needed them for an assignment.
          This app will have the best of both worlds.
          The ability to log in topics learned and also have reminders and random quizzes for students to learn even more efficiently.
          Here is a link to the prject (On going and not yet finished.)
